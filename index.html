      My silly cat (silly car) is so silly. He has the most expressive face, and sometimes he gets so
      caught up in his own fun that he forgets the world around him. This picture perfectly captures his silliness.
      See how his tongue is sticking out? He's probably in the middle of a "hunt" for a dust bunny or some other
      imaginary foe. He might look fierce, but trust me, it's all part of his silly charm! He's the kind of cat who
      can turn the simplest things into an adventure, and I can't help but laugh at his antics.
